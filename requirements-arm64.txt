# ARM64 Linux Requirements
# For face detection/recognition on ARM64 VMs and Raspberry Pi
#
# Install: pip install -r requirements-arm64.txt
#
# System dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian):
#   sudo apt install cmake build-essential libopencv-dev libatlas-base-dev v4l-utils
#
# System dependencies (Fedora):
#   sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ opencv-devel atlas-devel v4l-utils

# Core - OpenCV without GUI dependencies (smaller footprint)
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0

# NumPy for array operations
numpy>=1.24.0

# Face Detection - MediaPipe (works on ARM64 Linux)
# Comment out if not needed - haar_cascade and opencv_dnn work without it
mediapipe>=0.10.0

# Face Recognition - dlib-based (OPTIONAL - slow to build on ARM64)
# Note: dlib may require cmake and build tools on ARM64
# Building can take 10-30 minutes. Skip if you only need detection.
# sudo apt install cmake build-essential
# dlib>=19.24.0
# face-recognition>=1.3.0

# TFLite Runtime for edge inference (ARM64 optimized)
# Choose ONE of these based on your platform:
# For Raspberry Pi OS: tflite-runtime
# For generic ARM64 Linux: tflite-runtime or ai-edge-litert
# tflite-runtime>=2.14.0

# API Server
fastapi>=0.109.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0
python-multipart>=0.0.6  # For file uploads

# Configuration
pyyaml>=6.0

# Image processing utilities
Pillow>=10.0.0
